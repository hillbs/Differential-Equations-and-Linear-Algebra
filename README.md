# Differential-Equations-and-Linear-Algebra
Based on G Strang 2014, a collection of python notebooks
This is a collection of ipynb that match the excellent teaching in Strang's 2104 text with a how to do it in python, mainly sympy.
The emphasis in these notebooks is on conceptual development. This takes precedence over efficient numerical methods. At another level, the solutions and examples are around analytical solutions first, with numerical solutions only a second.

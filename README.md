# Differential-Equations-and-Linear-Algebra
The material in this collection is a collection of IPYNB that have as a central theme Linear Algebra and its application.
The first past is based on the 18.086 MIT course. 
Based on G Strang 2014, a collection of python notebooks
This is a collection of ipynb that match the excellent teaching in Strang's 2104 text with a how to do it in python, mainly sympy.
The emphasis in these notebooks is on conceptual development. This takes precedence over efficient numerical methods. The solutions and examples are algebraic first, with numerical solutions only where algebraic solutions are not possible. 
The remaining notebooks are a collection of examples around applied LA in sport analytics and other diverse areas.
